# JavaScript-Core-3-Classwork-Week4-London8

This repo contains exercises for use in class.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`

The exercises are split into three folders: `A-make-tests-pass`, `B-write-tests` and `C-TDD`
Within each of these folders there are `mandatory` exercises which you should try and complete during class. There are also `extra` exercises which you can try and complete if you have time, but you are not required to finish them.

## Usage

To run the tests from the terminal, run the command `npm test`.

To keep the tests running (auto updating when you save files), run the command: `npm test -- --watch` then press `a` to run all the tests and keep watching the files for changes. To quit the tests, type `q`.

To run a specifc test, run `npm test <filname>` for example `npm test remove-vowels` (that will run only the files that matches remove-vowels, i.e. remove-vowels.test.js)

### Pass Tests

The first set of exercises involve a set of tests that we will write code to make it pass. You can run only the tests in the _A-make-tests-pass_ folder by running `npm test A-make-tests-pass` or you can run them with a watch with `npm test A-make-tests-pass --watch`.

### Write Tests

The second set of exercises involve implemented code that we will add tests for. You can run only the tests in the _B-write-tests_ folder by running `npm test B-write-tests` or you can run them with a watch with `npm test B-write-tests --watch`.

Think about **edge cases** while writing tests.

### TDD

The final exercise involves using TDD to implement the function. You can run only the tests in the _C-TDD_ folder by running `npm test C-TDD` or you can run them with a watch with `npm test C-TDD --watch`.
