The Greeting Kata

Requirement 1
Write a method `greet(name)` that interpolates `name` in a simple greeting. For example, when `name` is "Bob", the method should return a string `"Hello, Bob."`.

Requirement 2
Handle `nulls` by introducing a stand-in. For example, when name is `null`, then the method should return the string `"Hello, my friend."`

Requirement 3
Handle shouting. When name is all uppercase, then the method should shout back to the user. For example, when `name` is `"JERRY"` then the method should return the string `"HELLO JERRY!"`


Requirement 4
Handle two names of input. When `name` is an array of two names, then both names should be printed. For example, when `name` is `["Jill", "Jane"]`, then the method should return the string `"Hello, Jill and Jane."`

Requirement 5
Handle an arbitrary number of `names` as input. When `name` represents more than two names, separate them with commas and close with an Oxford comma and "and". For example, when `name` is `["Amy", "Brian", "Charlotte"]`, then the method should return the string `"Hello, Amy, Brian, and Charlotte."`
